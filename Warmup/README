This folder is included with a single CIFAR-10 dataset, named "data_batch_1".
Both K-Means have K-Means++ have been implemented in Python.

To run the K-Means algorithm on this dataset, type:

python warmup.py

By default, k=5. After the algorithm finishes, the progam will display the
mean images of the clusters as well as a plot of the objective function as a
function of iteration.

To run the K-Means++ algorithm on this dataset, type:

python warmup_plus.py

By default, k=5. After the algorithm finishes, the progam will display the
mean images of the clusters as well as a print the objective function.

After running either K-Means or K-Means++ on the dataset, view the 25
representative images (the closest images to the cluster means) by typing:

python warmup_process.py
